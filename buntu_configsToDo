Tab-Manager replace
Open dconf-editor
Go to org/gnome/desktop/wm/keybindings
Move the value '<Alt>Tab' from switch-applications to switch-windows
Optionally move '<Shift><Alt>Tab' from switch-applications-backward to switch-windows-backward
If you want switch-windows to work across desktops, not just in the current desktop, you can also uncheck org/gnome/shell/window-switcher/current-workspace-only (Courtesy of @CharlBotha)
Close dconf-editor
Press <Alt>F2, then type r to restart Gnome.
The last step does not always appear to be necessary, but it should not hurt (especially since it does not close any of your running applications).
